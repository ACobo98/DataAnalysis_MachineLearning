    "# 🧪 Autonomous Activity: Dimensionality Reduction on Embryo Development Timelapse\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on activity, you will apply a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze real microscopy data. The dataset contains time-lapse images of normal and mutant embryos. Each image stack has approximately 450 frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Objectives:**\n",
    "- Explore, visualize, and preprocess multi-frame `.tif` images.\n",
    "- Test and compare different data normalization strategies (e.g., [0,1] scaling vs StandardScaler).\n",
    "- Use PCA, SVD, t-SNE, UMAP, and Autoencoders to extract and visualize developmental trajectories.\n",
    "- Identify biological differences in developmental dynamics between embryo types.\n",
    "- Reflect on the advantages, limitations, and behaviors of each technique.\n",
